# Problems

If you're currently a student in an Algobattle lab course, you've probably wondered how exactly the problems work, found
weird behaviour that you think might be a bug, or wanted to find out the exact file format it will accept. This page
teaches you how to get all that info from just the files you've already got in your Algobattle project folder!

!!! note
    This page goes over the anatomy of an Algobattle problem and how you can get what you're looking for from your
    project folder. This means it's mainly aimed at students who are trying to get more familiar with the course or a
    particular problem they're dealing with and course instructors who want to get an overview over how they work.
    If you instead are a course instructor looking to make a problem from scratch the
    [instructor tutorial](instructor/problem_basic.md) has more detailed info on that process.
