# Instructor's Corner

This section is all about the stuff behind the scenes. It covers how you can structure the course and detailed info on
how to interact with the framework. Individual pages are largely independent of each other and can be read in sequence
or used as a reference as needed.

## Overview

- The [teaching concept](teaching_english.md) provides a high level overview of the project, what a full course looks
    like, and what our goals are.

- The problem pages discuss how to create your own problems for students to solve. The [intro](problem/intro.md) and
    [basic section](problem/problem_file.md) cover everything you need to know to get started and work with most
    types of problems. However, the framework is incredibly versatile and lets you create much more complex and out of
    the box problems than you might initially think. The following pages dive into more detail on everything else.

- [Battle types](battles.md) discusses how you can customize the Algobattle match process itself by writing your own
    battle types.
