# Instructor's Corner

This section is all about the stuff behind the scenes. It covers how you can structure the course and detailed info on
how to interact with the framework. Individual pages are largely independent of each other and can be read in sequence
or used as a reference as needed.

## Overview

- The [teaching concept](teaching_english.md) provides a high level overview of the project, what a full course looks
    like, and what our goals are.

- The problem pages discuss how to create your own problems for students to solve. The [basic section](problem_basic.md)
    covers everything you need to know to get started and work with most types of problems. However, the framework is
    incredibly versatile and lets you create much more complex and out of the box problems than you might initially
    think. The [advanced page](problem_advanced.md) goes over working with these.

- [Battle types](battles.md) discusses how you can customize the Algobattle match process itself by writing your own
    battle types.

- Finally, the [Algobattle Web](web.md) section gives a quick intro to our associated web framework which you can use to
    host tournaments, distribute files to your students, and have them hand in their code to you.
