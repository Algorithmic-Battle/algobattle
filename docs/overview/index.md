The tutorial describes the basics of how the Algobattle framework works and how to use it. It's the ideal place to start
reading and should be self explanatory without any other background knowledge.

If you want more detailed information about what you can do with it you can check out the [student](../student/index.md)
and [instructor](../instructor/index.md) guides, depending on what your role is.
