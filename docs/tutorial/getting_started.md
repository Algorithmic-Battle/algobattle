# Getting Started

## Getting a problem

The idea behind the Algobattle framework is that course instructors will come up with some problem (in the theoretical
computer science meaning) that students will then write code to solve. The Algobattle program can then take the
problem definition and the code from all the student teams and score how good each team is at solving the problem.

///tip
Now's a great time to remember to activate the Python environment you installed Algobattle into
(`conda activate algobattle`).
///

### Problem spec files

The most common way your instructors will give you problem definitions is by uploading them to your Algobattle website.
On the specific problem's page you can then download an Algobattle problem spec file with the `.algo` extension. This
file contains all the information we need.

///info | A peek behind the curtain
Despite their very fancy looking extension, `.algo` files really just zip files with a few files inside. Algobattle uses
these to set up your project folders for you, but it doesn't handle things very well if you feed it data that doesn't
have that structure, so the file extension is there to remind you that you're not meant to process these files manually.
If you're curious you can unzip them and take a look inside yourself.
///

### Installed problems

Another way is to install a Python package that provides one or more problems. For example, our
[Algobattle Problem](https://github.com/Benezivas/algobattle-problems) package which contains a selection of basic
problems. We can download it and install it with pip after navigating into its directory

```console
pip install .
```

## Setting up the workspace

Now we can set up our dev environment where we write the code to solve the problem. I'll be showing you some folder
structures throughout but obviously the exact structure and names aren't mandatory. Let's start with a base folder which
should probably contain a `.git` folder and not much else.

With the console in our base folder we can use Algobattle to initialize our project for us, you can use either a
problem spec or an installed problem for this.

/// tab | Problem spec
```console
algobattle init -p path/to/spec/file.algo
```
///

/// tab | Installed problem
```console
algobattle init -p "Problem Name"
```
///

/// note
This tutorial will use the Pairsum problem as an example, if you're following along your project folder will look
slightly different depending on which problem you chose and what your course instructors decided to include with it.
///

Once this has run the folder should look something like this

/// tab | Problem spec
``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
└─ Pairsum
   ├─ generator/
   │  └─ Dockerfile
   ├─ results/
   ├─ solver/
   │  └─ Dockerfile
   ├─ .gitignore
   ├─ algobattle.toml
   ├─ description.md    # this file may be missing, don't worry if it is!
   └─ problem.py
```
///

/// tab | Installed problem
``` { .sh .no-copy }
.
└─ Pairsum
   ├─ generator/
   │  └─ Dockerfile
   ├─ results/
   ├─ solver/
   │  └─ Dockerfile
   ├─ .gitignore
   └─ algobattle.toml
```
///

What Algobattle has done is make a new project directory specific to this problem we're working with, and then
initialized all the required files and folders in it. Let's navigate into it for the rest of the tutorial.

```console
cd Pairsum
```

## The `algobattle.toml` config file

Project level configuration is done inside the `algobattle.toml` file so let's take a look at what's in there already.

/// tab | Problem spec
```toml
[match]
problem = "Pairsum"
# there might be more settings here

[problems."Pairsum"]
location = "problem.py"

[teams."Red Pandas"]
generator = "generator"
solver = "solver"

[project]
results = "results"
```
///

/// tab | Installed problem
```toml
[match]
problem = "Pairsum"

[teams."Red Pandas"]
generator = "generator"
solver = "solver"

[project]
results = "results"
```
///

The config file is split into a few tables, `match` specifies exactly what each Algobattle match is going to look like.
This means that you will probably never want to change things in there since you want to develop your programs for the
same conditions they're going to see during the scored matches run on the server. Feel free to play with the `teams`,
`problems`, and `project` tables as much as you want, nothing in them affects the structure of the match or anything
on the server. In particular, the team name used here doesn't need to match the one used on your Algobattle website.
The filled in settings so far all just are paths to where Algobattle can find certain files or folders. There's a lot
more things you can configure, but we're happy with the default values for now.

/// tip
If you're curious what exactly everything in here means you can read the [config docs](/advanced/config.md). But for
now we recommend staying here since things will be much clearer after you're familiar with things here.
///

## The `problem.py` file

///note
This will only exist if you used a problem spec file.
///

This is what Algobattle uses as the problem definition. Once you're familiar with the way Algobattle does things
you can cross-reference this to see what exactly your code needs to do. But it's also not directly meant to be
human-readable and easily understandable, in particular if you're not familiar with Python and Pydantic.

## The `description.*` file

///note
This will only exist if you used a problem spec file and your course instructors included it.
///

This is the version of the problem definition that's more fun to read. It can be whatever your course instructors
wanted to include, but most commonly is a Markdown or Pdf file.
