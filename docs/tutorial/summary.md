# Conclusion

If you've made it all the way through the tutorial you're now probably ready to start coding things yourself! There's a
lot of stuff left to cover, but none of it is essential to get started and can be more easily understood once you're a
bit more familiar with the framework. Feel free to try things out and come back to either the tutorial, or the
[advanced topics](/advanced/index.md) whenever you're having questions.

Hope you have fun with Algobattle!
