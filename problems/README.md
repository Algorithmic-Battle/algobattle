# Problem Files used in Practice
This directory contains several problem tasks that you may use for your
students. Each problem directory contains a `README.md` describing the problem
and the I/O that the generator and solver use. The `generator` and `solver`
directories contain dummy solvers that output instances which are technically
legal, but rather unexiting.

The simplest problem is currently the `pairsum` problem, which is regularly used
as a primer task at the start of the lab by the TCS group of RWTH Aachen
University. For this task, a simple randomized generator and solver are 
implemented which you may use for to see how the program behaves when the
solver runs into a timeout at some instance size.
