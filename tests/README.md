# Tests for algobattle
This directory contains a number of tests for the framework as well as for
specific problems. If you create your own problem, you should write tests for it and add them to this folder. Calling
```
python -m unittest
```
runs a complete set of tests. These may take 3+ minutes, depending on your system specifications.
